For Sprint 3:
presteps: setup DB

- Login (Done)
- Look at reqs and make sure it complies and if not make it comply

//- Signup (Done with Login right now)

- Inventory page with update item button and delete item button (UPDATE/DELETE queries)

- COPY IT FOR DETAIL PAGE -- one product


Check all reqs-- JSOn
- (Biggest) Customer view page where they see all products (SELECT query) -- return JSON

Extension:
- Home Page
- Detail page with analytics

Things to keep in mind:

- code for mobile first and then web (responsive)
- ANDI and valid html both are good for all pages


Generate order button that queries products which are below threshold and submit button that makes the query to update the quantities(order them) for all
If this doesn't work then simply show the past order list by dates

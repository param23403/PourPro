For Sprint 3:
presteps: setup DB

- Login (Done)

- Signup (Done with Login right now)

- Inventory page with add item button and delete item button (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE queries)

- Customer view page where they see all products (SEELCT query)

Extension:
- Home Page
- Detail page with analytics

Things to keep in mind:

- code for mobile first and then web (responsive)
- ANDI and valid html both are good for all pages


Generate order button that queries products which are below threshold and submit button that makes the query to update the quantities(order them) for all
If this doesn't work then simply show the past order list by dates

For Sprint 3:
presteps: setup DB
- Login
- Signup

- Inventory page with add item button and delete item button

- Customer view page where they see all products

Extension:
- Home Page
- Detail page with analytics

Things to keep in mind:

- code for mobile first and then web (responsive)
- ANDI and valid html both are good for all pages
